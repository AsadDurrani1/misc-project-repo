# misc-project-repo
A collection of side projects I'll be working on in my free time. A quick summary:

dog-cat classifier - A one-layer classifier neural network, programmed from scratch using only numpy. Data manipulation, linear algebra, and derivatives were all done manually.

Matrix Calculator - A JavaFX GUI application for performing basic operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, row-reduction, and taking discriminants.

Paint - A simple GUI drawing program written in JavaFX. Allows users to draw with several different shapes, colours, and line thicknesses.

tic-tac-toe - A python GUI implementation of the game tic-tac-toe using the minimax optimization algorithm for best computer play.

pomodoro-timer - A python GUI application that I'll sometimes use for studying. Sets a timer for 25 minutes, plays a sound to let you know it's time to take a break for 5 minutes, and repeats.

Connect 4 and 2048 - Text based implementations of connect 4 and 2048, made before I had a good understanding of GUI's. :)
