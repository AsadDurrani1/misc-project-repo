# misc-project-repo
A collection of side projects I'll be working on in my free time. A quick summary:

dog-cat classifier - A one-layer classifier neural network, programmed from scratch using only numpy. Data manipulation, linear algebra, and derivatives were all done manually.

Matrix Calculator - A JavaFX GUI application for performing basic operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, row-reduction, and taking discriminants.

tic-tac-toe - A python GUI implementation of the game tic-tac-toe using the minimax optimization algorithm for best computer play.

pomodoro-timer - A python GUI application that I'll sometimes use for studying. Sets a timer for 25 minutes, plays a sound to let you know it's time to take a break for 5 minutes, and repeats.

2048 - A text-based implementation of the game 2048 in python.
