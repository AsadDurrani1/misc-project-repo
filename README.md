# misc-project-repo
A collection of side projects I'll be working on in my free time. A quick summary:

dog-cat classifier - A one-layer classifier neural network, programmed from scratch using only numpy.
Matrix Calculator - A JavaFX GUI application for performing basic operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, row-reduction, and taking discriminants.
