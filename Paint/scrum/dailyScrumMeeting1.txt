Oct 29, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Received assignment and provided contact information for teammates. 
	Obstacles : None.

Oct 30, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     :Completed User Story 3.
	Obstacles :Bug in making a rectangle making it that rectangle is only created in 1 direction, from the origin point to the bottom right.

Oct 31, 2018
	Yesterday : Thought to have completed User Story 3.
	Today     : Continued to work on User Story 3 in order to fix the bug preventing the rectangle to be drawn in all directions and is now 
				completed. Completed User Story 4 in order to accurately provide feedback to user in the process of creating a rectangle. 
				Completed Bug 2 making it so that the shape choosing buttons get toggled and highlighted while in use. Started work on Bug 1.
	Obstacles : Obstacle currently facing for Bug 2 which requires the images used for the icon to be within the file itself, in order for them
				to be visible regardless of user location, and replacing the text on the button with suitable image, i.e. rectangle image for 
				"Rectangle", circle image for "Circle", etc. 
	
Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday :Completed User Story 3 and 4 and Bug 6.
	Today     :Continued to make progress on Bug 1. Successfully got the shape chooser panel button to have images.
	Obstacles :Running into problems having the image source be within the file, so that it can be used on all devices. Problem
				sourcing the images from within the package.

Nov 2, 2018
	Yesterday :Completed User Story 3, 4 and Bug 6.
	Today     :Completed Bug 1, successfully showing images of of the shapes on the buttons. Began planning out the implementation of 
				Square and User Story 6.
	Obstacles :Getting the new buttons to work consistently, fixing bugs which would not find the sourced image when the program 
				was being initiated, as it would go into a infinite loop and not start the program. 

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday :Completed Bug 1.
	Today     :Fixed up a issue which persisted through the implementation of Bug1 where the Squiggle picture would not show. Also
				changed the layout of the shape choosing buttons so now they display both text and image, they are just a little 
				bigger in size. Also, began the implementation of drawing a square.
	Obstacles :Despite thinking that the images on the buttons would be visible for everyone, the image for squiggle would not 
				show up even though the code for it was the same as the code for the rest of the shapes. However, this was the only
				one with the problem.

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday :Fixed the bugs around displaying the images in the bug and began the implementation of square.
	Today     :Continued to work on the implementation of square.
	Obstacles :Although at first it seemed like the implementation of a square would be quite similar to the 
				implementation of a rectangle. It turned out to actually be more complex than the implementation
				of a rectangle. Precisely due to the fact that the side length of the square depended on which 
				direction you dragged the mouse further into unlike rectangle which had a unique length for height
				and width.

Nov 5, 2018
	Yesterday :Continued to working on User Story 9, which was implementing the Square shape and its drawing.
	Today     :Today, first early on finished User Story 9 (drawing a square). And also began and completed the 
				implementation of the square feedback (User Story 10), allowing the user to see the square they will
				draw before actually drawing it. 
	Obstacles :Coming up with a way to draw a square without having a long, repetitve function with multiple 
				nested loops, instead having a function that completes the same task, except in 1/3 the code.

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday :Completed Square and Square feedback.
	Today     :Began planning out Bug 3 and brainstorming possible design patterns or combination of design 
				patterns which can be used to improve the architecture of the selection mode.
	Obstacles :Currently the biggest obstacle regarding this bug is primarily difficulty deciding which user
				pattern is best suitable for this situation, as it feels like there's more than one which can
				get the job done, its just a matter of which is most effective to implement. Moreover, it 
				seems as if Bug 3 and Bug 9 can both be solved together, using an effective design pattern,
				however, currently not sure if possible.  

Nov 7, 2018
	Yesterday :Began on Bug 3.
	Today     :Today, while figuring out how to implement bug 3, came to the realization that bug 9 is very
				closely related to bug 9 and implementing bug 9 would actually do much of what is expected on
				bug 3, so diverted attention to bug 9 and began figuring out how it works.
	Obstacles :Challenge figuring out how factory design pattern and strategy design pattern can work together
				from bug 9 and bug 10 

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday :Began planning the implementation of Bug 3 and found it led to thinking about Bug 9.
	Today     :Diverted attention completely to Bug 9 and made progress on it, hopefully reaching a final
				state for it, without needing future changes for the bug.
	Obstacles :Planned the implementation of Bug 10 with teammate in order to see how it can work with Bug 9,
				trying to figure out how it works with Bug 9 in order to create the shape from within the 
				strategy design pattern implementation. 

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday : Completed Bug 9.
	Today     :Continued working on Bug 10 with team member reaching an almost complete state.
	Obstacles :Running into some difficulties regarding the technicalities of the Factory/Strategy combination design pattern.

Nov 10, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on Bug 10 with partner.
	Today     :Reviewed Bug 9 and Bug 3 to ensure all requirements for the Bugs were fulfilled, and made sure everything implemented
				for those Bugs worked fine with the addition of the completion of Bug 10. Also, looked for new Bugs which have arised
				since the implementation of the design patterns. Found that the the i count has stopped functioning. Also, thought about
				possible new features which could be added to improve functionality. 
	Obstacles :Looking for why the i counter stopped incrementing.
	
Nov 11, 2018
	Yesterday :Reviewed to find the potential bugs in the overall product after the addition of bugs and design patterns.
	Today     :Continued to work on new features to improve functionality such as implementation of functions such as "New" and "Undo" as well
				as tried to find potential ways to increment the i shape counter correctly. 
	Obstacles :Found a way to increment i correctly for the most part, however, running into problems where once polyline is selected and drawn
				even once, it messes up the increments of the i shape counter for all additional shapes drawn after the fact.
	
Nov 12, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on the i counter and began implementation of "New" and "Undo"
	Today     :Continued to try and figure out why the i incrementer is not working properly, as well as completed the implementation of "New",
				"Undo", "Redo", as well as "Exit".
	Obstacles :Struggling to fix the bug in the incrementer, it all works perfectly fine, until Polyline is called and made, after the creation of
				the first polyline however, the incrementation of the i counter begins to mess up.

Nov 13, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on the i incrementer to see why it was not working properly, as well as completed the implementation of some MenuBar features.
	Today     :Worked with teammate (herber30) to overcome big mistake in the implementation of Bugs 9 and 10 which was impeding our ability to implement
				the i counter, due to the previously wrong implementation of the design patterns.
	Obstacles :Stopping previous strategies from running once the strategy was changed.

Nov 14, 2018
	Yesterday :Fixed implementation of Bug 9 and 10, and implemented i counter, and implemented some menu bar
				features
	Today     :Worked on trying to implement more menubar features such as cut, copy, and paste.
	Obstacles :Accessing specific shapes to cut, copy, or paste.
	
Nov 15, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on trying to implement more features from the menubar such as cut, copy, and paste.
	Today     :Worked on the presentation of the final version of the code by fixing and adding javadocs and removing all unnecessary code.
	Obstacles :Accessing specific shapes to cut, copy, or paste.
