	Yesterday :
	Today     : Started on User Story 6. Added
	colour-picker sidebar. There's a little bug 
	that has to do with the previously drawn
	objects also getting their color changed when
	a new color is picked.

	Obstacles : Converting java color strings into
	CSS style to use for the color buttons.

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday : fixed some code in the paintpanel, refactored code in 
		ColourChooserPanel to be more readable
	Today     : User Story 6, need to implement a fill/outline
		option.

		Done User Story 6, also made some minor changes to class
		PaintPanel to fix shape counter. 
	Obstacles : Code is getting cluttered in PaintModel. Consider making
		drawRect(g) and drawCircle(g) in the Rect and Circle classes.
		Also maybe a Mode class so we can easily keep track of 
		fillStyle, colour, line thickness, etc.

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday : Encountered a substantial bug in the drawing of filled in rectangles. Some shapes take priority over others.
		Shapes should always be drawn in the order they were originally drawn.
	Today     : Want to FIX the bug that showed up yesterday by working on Bug 4. Having a single stack that contains all shapes
		in the model is much more flexible, and will ensure all shapes are drawn in the right order.

Nov 7, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Introduced DrawingStrategy interface, implemented by each shape. Worked with mehtaku6 on bug 7.
			He copied and pasted draw methods from paintpanel into the shape objects so that each object
			knows how to draw itself. I worked on combining the arraylists in paintmodel into one single
			list of Shape objects. This gives us bug 4 for free.
			This fixes the bug of things being drawn in the wrong order.
	Obstacles : Understanding how commands vs. strategies work, their pros and cons, etc.

Nov 13, 2018
	Yesterday : talked to group members about bugs 9 and 10, and how they relate and differ to bugs 7 and 8.

	Today     : Completed bugs 7 and 8, refactored drawing strategy to be drawing command, so that the paint model now invokes
		    the command built in to each shape to draw itself onto the canvas. Refactored the undo/redo code. Added current
		    colour display like in microsoft paint. Changed default background to white. Made it so that the shape counter
		    is drawn after all the shapes and is not covered up.

	Obstacles : Figuring out which parts of the code were redundant in bugs 7 and 8, didn't want to implement a design pattern
		    that was unnecessary. (implementing command in this way ended up saving 50+ lines of code).
