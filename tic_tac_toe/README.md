This project implements a barebones GUI tic-tac-toe game
using the python library tkinter.

To play the game simply run the file gui_controller in
python 3.7+. Alternatively, one can run the file
console_controller.

A user can choose to play against either a human
or computer opponent. The computer opponent uses the
minimax algorithm to recursively search for its next
move, avoiding any move that leads to a loss.
